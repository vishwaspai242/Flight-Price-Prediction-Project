# Flight-Price-Prediction-Project---Flip-Robo

Predicting the prices of flight tickets

### Problem Statement:

Anyone who has booked a flight ticket knows how unexpectedly the prices vary. The cheapest available ticket on a given flight gets more and less expensive over time. This usually happens as an attempt to maximize revenue based on -

- Time of purchase patterns (making sure last-minute purchases are expensive)

- Keeping the flight as full as they want it (raising prices on a flight which is filling up in order to reduce sales and hold back inventory for those expensive last-minute expensive purchases)

So, we have to work on a project where we collect data of flight fares with other features and work to make a model to predict fares of flights. This project contains three phases-

#### 1. Data Collection:
We have done web scraping to collect the data of flight ticket prices from the well known website yatra where I found more features of flights compared to other websites and I fetch data for different locations. As per the requirement we need to build the model to predict the prices of different flight tickets.

#### 2. Data Analysis:
After cleaning the data, we have to do some analysis on the data to find out the following details.

Do airfares change frequently? Do they move in small increments or in large jumps? Do they tend to go up or down over time? What is the best time to buy so that the consumer can save the most by taking the least risk? Does price increase as we get near to departure date? Is Indigo cheaper than Jet Airways? Are morning flights expensive?

#### 3. Model Building:
After collecting the data, we need to build a machine learning model. Before model building do all data pre-processing steps. Try different models with different hyper parameters and select the bestmodel.

Follow the complete life cycle of data science. Include all the steps like:

- Data Cleaning

- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Data Pre-processing

- Model Building

- Model Evaluation

- Selecting the best model
